> WebExtension to add at:// links to Bluesky social app

Adding `at://` (actually `web+at://`) protocol links to the Bluesky context menu.

Useful especially for easy navigation into [pdsls.dev](https://pdsls.dev), which will let you browse the underlying PDS for a post, via [`registerProtoclHandler` support](https://github.com/notjuliet/pdsls/issues/6).

# Example

Option menu with a `at://` link to the post:
